msgid "The advantage of a native 64-bit application is that it gets a 64-bit address space and hence can address far more than 4GB (how much depends on the version of Windows, but in principle 8TB).  This allows a single process to take advantage of more than 4GB of RAM (if available) and for R's memory manager to more easily handle large objects (in particular those of 1GB or more).  The disadvantages are that all the pointers are 8 rather than 4 bytes and so small objects are larger and more data has to be moved around, and that less external software is available for 64-bit versions of the OS. The 64-bit compilers are able to take advantage of extra features of all x86-64 chips (more registers, SSE2/3 instructions, @dots{}) and so the code may run faster despite using larger pointers.  The 64-bit build is nowadays usually slightly faster than the 32-bit build on a recent CPU (Intel Core 2 or later or AMD equivalent)."

An extreme example is the Microsoft Access/Excel ODBC drivers: if you have installed 64-bit Microsoft Office you can only install the 64-bit drivers and so need to use 64-bit @code{RODBC} and hence R.

Note that development of that BLAS was frozen in 2010 so you will not find versions for recent CPUs.)"
