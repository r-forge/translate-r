<h3 align="center">UNDER THE CONSTUCTION NOW</h3>
<p>edited by Chel Hee Lee.</p>

<!--
R supports the translation of its messages, including error and
warning messages and menu labels.  This document is intended for
<a href="TranslationTeams.html">translation teams</a> but starts
with a user's view of the process extracted from the <em>R
Installation and Administration Manual</em>.

<p> These instructions apply to R 3.x.

<p>The MacOS X GUI also has translatable messages: see the separate
section at the end of this document.

<h2>Message Domains</h2>

<p>Messages are divided into <em>domains</em>, and translations may
be available for some or all messages in a domain.  R makes use of the
following domains.

<ul>
<li>Domain <code>R</code> for C-level error and warning messages from
  the R interpreter.

<li>Domain <code>R-</code><var>pkg</var> for the R <code>stop</code>
and <code>warning</code> messages in each package, including
<code>R-base</code> for the <code>base</code> package.

<li>Domain <var>pkg</var> for the C-level messages in each package.

<li>Domain <code>RGui</code> for the menus etc of the R for Windows
GUI front-end.

</ul>

<p>Dividing up the messages in this way allows R to be extensible: as
packages are loaded, their message translation catalogues can be loaded
too.

<p> Domains <code>R</code> and <code>RGui</code> are part of
  the <code>base</code> package, as well as <code>R-base</code> for
  the interpreted code in that package.

<p>Translations are looked for by domain according to the currently
specified language, as specifically as possible, so for example an
Austrian (<code>de_AT</code>) translation catalogue will be used in
preference to a generic German one (<code>de</code>) for an Austrian
user.  However, if a specific translation catalogue exists but does
not contain a translation, the less specific catalogues are consulted.
For example, R has catalogues for <code>en_GB</code> that translate
the Americanisms (e.g. <code>gray</code>) in the standard messages
into English.

<p>Translations in the right language but the wrong charset can
generally be made use of by on-the-fly re-encoding.  The
<code>LANGUAGE</code> variable can be a colon-separated list, for
example <code>se:de</code>, giving a set of languages in decreasing
order of preference.

<p>If no suitable translation catalogue is found or a particular
message is not translated in the selected catalogue, English is used.

The translated catalogues are stored as binary files with extension
<code>.mo</code> in the <code>translations</code> package.  That
package contains one directory for each language.  Each language
directory has a single subdirectory <code>LC_MESSAGES</code>, and
within that a file for each domain. So the Japanese translations are
installed in the directory
<pre>
library/translations/ja/LC_MESSAGES
</pre>
which currently contains a <code>.mo</code> file for each of 22 domains.

<p>
(The `language' <code>en@quot</code> is English with Unicode
bidirectional quotation marks for use in a UTF-8 locale.)

<p>
The code migration in R 3.0.0 means that
packages <code>graphics</code> and <code>utils</code> now have C code
(and messages which need translation).  You may find that some of the
messages were previously translated and can be found at the bottom of
the <code>R</code> and <code>R-base</code> catalogues: see the use of
compendia below for how to get these copied across.

<h2>Translation prerequisites</h2>

You need GNU <code>gettext</code> installed: specifically
<code>gettext-tools</code> if your system differentiates it from
<code>gettext-runtime</code>.  (Linux users will not need the
development RPM.)  The <code>gettext</code> manual is the best
reference source.  Command-line 32-bit Windows versions of the tools
are available from <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies/gettext-tools.zip"><tt>www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies</tt></a>.

Emacs users can use PO mode to help with managing translations: this
is described in the <code>gettext</code> manual.

<p>There are some Linux-alike tools developed for the
<a
href="http://i18n.kde.org/translation-howto/gui-specialized-apps.html">KDE</a>
project, notably <code>KBabel</code>.

<p>Windows users can find pre-compiled versions
of <code>gettext</code> at any mirror of the GNU archive.
The <code>poEdit</code> editor is recommended by
the <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/participate/translation-windows/s1-poedit.html">Fedora
    translators</a>, and comes with the <code>gettext</code> tools needed.


<h2>Preparing and installing a translation</h2>

Suppose you wanted to prepare a Slovenian translation for the
<code>splines</code> package.  The ISO 639 code for Slovenian is
<code>sl</code>.  Go to the <code>src/library/splines/po</code>
directory and run (preferably in a Slovenian locale)
<pre>
    msginit -i R-splines.pot -o R-sl.po
    msginit -i splines.pot -o sl.po
</pre>
If this does not work for you, just copy the files to the names given
and fill in the header.

<p>Now check over the header entries and fill in the
<code>msgstr</code> entries in these files.  The originals will look
like
<pre>
  # Slovenian translations for R package
  # Slovenski prevodi paketa R.
  # Copyright (C) 2005 THE R'S COPYRIGHT HOLDER
  # This file is distributed under the same license as the R package.
  # Prof Brian Ripley &lt;ripley@stats.ox.ac.uk&gt;, 2005.
  #
  msgid ""
  msgstr ""
  "Project-Id-Version: R 2.1.0\n"
  "Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: bugs@r-project.org\n"
  "POT-Creation-Date: 2005-01-25 17:26+0000\n"
  "PO-Revision-Date: 2005-02-04 08:37+0000\n"
  "Last-Translator: Prof Brian Ripley &lt;ripley@stats.ox.ac.uk&gt;\n"
  "Language-Team: Slovenian\n"
  "MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
  "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-2\n"
  "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
  "Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=(n%100==1 ? 0 : n%100==2 ? 1 : n%100==3 || n"
  "%100==4 ? 2 : 3);\n"

  #: splines.c:154
  msgid "'ord' must be a positive integer"
  msgstr ""
</pre>
If you leave a translation as <code>""</code> the untranslated message
(<code>msgid</code>) will be used.

<p>
Some messages have plural forms, e.g.
<pre>
  msgid        "Warning message:\n"
  msgid_plural "Warning messages:\n"
  msgstr[0]    ""
  msgstr[1]    ""
</pre>
The <code>Plural-Forms:</code> line tells you what these mean: in
languages with just singular and one plural, the first is singular and
the second is plural.  For languages without plurals, just give one
line starting <code>msgstr[0]</code>.  Slovenian would need four lines.

<p>Then compile and install the translated catalogues by
<pre>
    mkdir ${R_HOME}/library/translations/sl/LC_MESSAGES
    msgfmt -c --statistics -o ${R_HOME}/library/translations/sl/LC_MESSAGES/R-splines.mo R-sl.po
    msgfmt -c --statistics -o ${R_HOME}/library/translations/sl/LC_MESSAGES/splines.mo sl.po
</pre>
and when you next install R the translations will be ready for use.
Using <code>-c</code> enables a number of consistency checks that have
proven useful.  Using <code>--statistics</code> gives some details of
the coverage of the translations.

<p>
The process is the same for any other package,
including <code>base</code> (which contains 3 rather than 2 domains).

<p> Translators can choose any suitable encoding, but for
<code>RGui-ll.po</code> it is best to use the native encoding for the
language on Windows.  Otherwise, if possible choose an encoding that
the development team will be able to run your language in as a Linux
locale: UTF-8 is their first choice.

<p> Translators may find it useful to consult the <a
href="http://www.cbs.nl/isi/glossary/">ISI glossary of statistical
terms</a>.

<h3>Compendia</h3>

Sometimes you will encounter a translation you know you have done for
a different domain (which sometimes happens as code is migrated).
Then the <em>compendium</em> facility of <code>msgmerge</code> can be
very useful.  First delete any <code>fuzzy</code> translation which
has been generated, then use e.g.
<pre>
    msgmerge --update ll.po stats.pot -C other.po
</pre>
where the final <code>.po</code> file is used to pick up existing
translations (even those not in use there).  More than one compendium file
can be supplied.

<h3>C-like format strings</h3>

Some messages contain C-like format strings such as <code>"%s"</code> for
use either by <code>gettextf</code> in R or by the C-level <code>error</code>
functions.

<p>
It is important that these match exactly in the <code>msgid</code>
and <code>msgstr</code> lines: mismatches can cause R to crash or nonsense
to be output.

<p> 
The function <code>checkPoFiles</code> in
package <code>tools</code> implements a check: please make use of it
before finalizing your translations.  (It is run as part of the
installation procedure for translations: see the next sub-section.)

<h3>Installing all translations</h3>

If you are working within a copy of the R sources you can do
<pre>
cd po
make update-pkg-po update-RGui
</pre>
(On Windows, use <code>make -f Makefile.win</code>: it skips
the <code>en@auot</code> translations.) This will update the
translations for all languages, check them
with <code>tools::checkPoFiles</code>, compile all those which pass
the checks and install the translations in
the <code>translations</code> package.  The latter can then be copied
to an R installation to test the new translations.

<p>
This can be done on a per-package
basis <em>via</em> <code>tools::update_pkg_po</code>. (This does work
on Windows but skips the <code>en@auot</code> translations when not in
a UTF-8 locales.)

<h2>Submitting a translation</h2>

To submit a translation for inclusion in the R sources please make a
<code>tar</code> with all the source files you added, perhaps by (untested)
<pre>
    tar zcvf sl-po.tar.gz src/library/*/po/*sl.po
</pre>
and send it to the R core team.  It does not help to submit
the <code>.mo</code> files!

<p> Sending single files <em>via</em> email has caused a lot of
  corruption in the past.  To be safe, send a binary attachment
  as <code>.tar.gz</code> or <code>.zip</code> file.

<p>
Translations of messages in recommended packages should be sent to
their maintainers.

<h2>The MacOS X GUI</h2>

The MacOS X Cocoa GUI currently uses Apple's Cocoa localization
framework which is different from the gettext approach used by R, but
still very similar from translator's point of view. In the following
we will assume that the translation is done on a machine running Mac
OS X with Apple Developer Tools installed and the Mac-GUI project
sources present.

<p>Practically any resource, file or text used in the Mac-GUI can be
localized. The first elements to start with are text messages,
followed by GUI elements and finally images and supplemental
documentation. All those items are located in the "Resources" group of
the Mac-GUI project.

<h3>Adding support for a new language</h3>
<a name="mac_newt"><b>Adding a new translation</b></a> of a resource
is done as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Open the Mac-GUI project in Xcode and locate the resource to translate in the "Resources" group.</li>
  <li>Select the resource and click on "Get Info" (or press
  &lt;Cmd&gt;&lt;I&gt;).</li>
  <li>Click on "Add Localization.."</li>
  <li>Enter the ISO 639 code for the language.<br>Note: although the
  drop-down list offers full language names such as "German", please
  use ISO 639 codes (such as <code>de</code>) instead, because the use
  of full names is deprecated.</li>
  <li>There will be a new node in the resources tree listing the
  language you just created. Edit the resource to reflect the new
  language - see below for details.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are three basic sets of resources that need to be translated:
<ul>
  <li>Text messages (such as <code>"Cannot open file %@ for writing."</code>)</li>
  <li>GUI elements (such as buttons, text fields, labels etc.)</li>
  <li>Images (such as toolbar icons) and supplemental files (such as
  acknowledgements)</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Text messages</b> are located in the
<code>Localizable.strings</code> resource which is a text file of the
form <code>"english"="translation";</code>, for example (from the
German translation):

<pre>
"Cancel"="Abbrechen"; "Choose File"="W&auml;hlen Sie eineDatei";
</pre>

The corresponding file is created when a new localization is
added. Please use UTF-8 encoding when editing those files externally
(in Xcode select <code>Format</code> -&gt; <code>File Encoding</code>
-&gt; <code>Unicode (UTF-8)</code>).

<p><b>GUI elements</b> are located inside NIB files (NeXT Interface
Builder files). First step to add a localized version of a NIB file is
to follow the <a href="#mac_newt">"Adding a new translation"</a> step
above which will produce a copy of the English original that will have
to be translated. One way to translate such file would be to edit it
directly in the Interface Builder, but this is rather tedious and
would require some knowledge of Cocoa, therefore we use a more generic
approach. It is possible to generate the same "strings" files as used
for text messages and use those to translate GUI elements. To generate
such files, run

<pre>update.localization</pre>

in the Mac-GUI directory. This script will create a new directory
<code>Translated.strings</code> which contains strings files for each
NIB file and language, for example:
<code>MainMenu.de.strings</code>. This file has the same format as the
text messages strings file and should be translated the same
way. Before editing the file it is crucial to set the file encoding to
UTF-8! Once all necessary strings files are translated, they can be
used to translate the NIB file by running the script as follows:
<pre>update.localization -t</pre> Don't forget the <code>-t</code>
switch, otherwise your files in <code>Translated.strings</code> will
be overwritten! The existing NIB files are updated by this script to
reflect any changes in the strings files. Optionally the NIB files can
be manually tweaked if necessary, such as if the labels of some GUI
elements are longer than the element itself. Such minor changes will
be preserved by the <code>update.localization</code> script later.

<p><b>Other resources</b> are localized by simply editing the copy
that was made when using "Add Localization...". There are no automated
ways of modifying images or other resource files. Please note that any
resources that are no different from the English version don't need to
be copied using "Add Localization...". The GUI will automatically use
the English version if there is no localized version of the resource.

<h3>Submitting a Mac-GUI translation</h3> 

There are basically two
options how to perform and submit Mac-GUI translations:

<ul><li><b>Providing localized resources</b><br> 
This is the preferred method, but requires you to use Xcode and
understand the instructions above. When you localize resources, please
send us an archive containing <u>both</u> the English original and the
translated resources. This will allow us to incorporate your
translation even if the Mac-GUI project changed in the meantime. Let's
assume you have new resources for the language
<code>XX</code>. To create an archive for submission, type the
following in the Terminal while in the Mac-GUI directory:
<pre>tar fvcz res-XX.tar.gz English.lproj XX.lproj</pre>
Send the resulting archive <code>res-XX.tar.gz</code> to the Mac-GUI
authors.
</li>
<li><b>Using strings files only</b><br>
If you don't have a Mac or don't know how to follow the instructions
above, but you are sure you can translate the GUI into another
language, ask the Mac-GUI authors to send you the strings text files
for translation. You can edit those files using any editor that
supports UTF-8 and return the translated files to us. Since you have
no direct way of seeing the results of the translation, this method is
much less preferrable than using localized resources directly.
</li>
</ul>
