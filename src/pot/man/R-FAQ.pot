"data segment of the process (historically using the @code{brk} system call), "
"but this whole area is always contiguous.  The OS can only move the end of "
"this space, it cannot create any ``holes''. Since this operation is fairly "
"cheap, it is used for allocations of small pieces of memory.  However, the "
"side-effect is that even if there is just one byte that is in use at the end "
"of the data segment, the OS cannot release any memory at all, because it "
"cannot change the address of that byte.  This is actually more common than "
"it may seem, because allocating a lot of intermediate objects, then "
"allocating a result object and removing all intermediate objects is a very "
"common practice.  Since the result is allocated at the end it will prevent "
"the OS from releasing any memory used by the intermediate objects.  In "
"practice, this is not necessarily a problem, because modern operating "
"systems can page out unused portions of the virtual memory so it does not "
"necessarily reduce the amount of real memory available for other "
"applications.  Typically, small objects such as strings or pairlists will be "
"affected by this behavior, whereas large objects such as long vectors will "
"be allocated using @code{mmap} and thus not affected.  On Linux (and "
"possibly other Unix-like systems) it is possible to use the @code{mallinfo} "
"system call (also see the @url{https://rforge.net/mallinfo, mallinfo} "
"package) to query the allocator about the layout of the allocations, "
"including the actually used memory as well as unused memory that cannot be "
"released."
